## :notebook: Background:
The inspiration behind Groceries Desai-ded because as someone who likes to take screen shots of handwritten grocery lists and email them to myself; I needed to find a single place to store the grocery lists in order to reference them in the future. This way I could avoid accidentally deleting the lists I emailed myself. I hope this app will not only help me but also help you to.
